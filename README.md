This is a little one-page demonstration of that most basic cybernetic system, the thermostat. There's really no interactivity, but you can watch as a simulated small room in the real-life Fairbanks, Alaska is virtually climate-controlled by a thermostat and radiator.

It relies on node/npm and gulp.

To clone:

> git clone https://github.com/diceytroop/thermostat-model <folder to clone into>

Then, in that folder

> npm install

And finally

> gulp
